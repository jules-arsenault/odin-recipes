    <h3>Peep that lasagna</h3>

    <p>There's no such thing as an all-encompassing “best lasagna recipe.” 
        Sometimes only a full-on cooking project with layers of creamy béchamel and Bolognese will do. 
        Or, you may crave the rich comfort only a good homemade lasagna can bring, but prefer to keep it meat-free. 
        And then there are the nights you want a version like this: 
        An easy crowd-pleasing lasagna with layers of no-boil noodles, a luscious ricotta cheese mixture,
         and a streamlined meat sauce that comes to the table bubbling and burnished in a casserole dish big enough to feed a crowd.</p>
         <br>
    <p>While many lasagna recipes call for adding an assortment of meats (like ground beef, pork, or veal, among others), 
        this one simplifies the sauce, using just fennel-scented spicy Italian sausage. Feel free to swap in sweet Italian sausage if you prefer,
         or an Italian American-style turkey sausage if you don't eat pork. The other secret is adding a can of tomatoes with peppers and onions,
          creating a flavorful, meaty tomato sauce with minimal prep time. As for the cheese mixture, there are no shortcuts:
           Grating fresh mozzarella and a block of Parmesan on the coarse side of a box grater takes more effort than
            grabbing preshredded versions at the grocery store but makes a world of difference in flavor and texture.</p>
